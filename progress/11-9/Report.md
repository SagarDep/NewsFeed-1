* This week, I setup the initial project code, planned out future work (see mockup.jpg). I also 
configured my api key on google cloud console so that it can only be used in this android package. 
I also implemented Java.Source to handle data returned from https://newsapi.org/#apiSources. 
QueryUtils to use it is still a work in progress

* This week, I confirgured a basic Navigation Drawer for the different sections that will be in our app.
From this point I need to confirgure it with the acutucal news sections and use the api to get the news
feed for thoose sections

* This week I started looking into the database setup we would need to be able to support our history
tracking and machine learning goals. We have picked the news api's we are going to use so now I am also 
working on coming up with commmon format we can parse the API responses into.
