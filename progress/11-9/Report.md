* This week, I setup the initial project code, planned out future work (see mockup.jpg). I also 
configured my api key on google cloud console so that it can only be used in this android package. 
I also implemented Java.Source to handle data returned from https://newsapi.org/#apiSources. 
QueryUtils to use it is still a work in progress

* This week, I confirgured a basic Navigation Drawer for the different sections that will be in our app.
From this point I need to confirgure it with the acutucal news sections and use the api to get the news
feed for thoose sections
